INTERFACE

Monday:

2. make index (and "Everest" in nav) redirect to the user type's main page

Tuesday:

1. Style the class "errorlist" so it looks less bad (there's a nice one in sentence we could use)
   - when you do {{errors}} it has class errorlist, maybe just make it red or something

2. Improve login error messages

3. JSify recording directions

4. Delint, retest everything, check whether fns all have correct loginrequired/transaction


BACKEND

1. interleave mp3s when teacher creates mp3 (can we just have a download lesson option? - it would be significantly easier. What would this mean? Having them all as a playlist of separate mp3s? I think that's fine.)

2. Ajaxify sentences.html (a bit complicated I think, should avoid reloading audio -- I think only need to Ajaxify add translation and del everything.)

EXTRA

display related sentences during sentence creation (TFIDF) (did a little?)
