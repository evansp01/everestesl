BACKEND

1. interleave mp3s when teacher creates mp3 (can we just have a download lesson option? - it would be significantly easier. What would this mean? Having them all as a playlist of separate mp3s? I think that's fine.)

2. Ajaxify sentences.html (a bit complicated I think, should avoid reloading audio -- I think only need to Ajaxify add translation and del everything.)
