INTERFACE

1. Style the class "errorlist" so it looks less bad (there's a nice one in sentence we could use)
   - when you do {{errors}} it has class errorlist, maybe just make it red or something.
   - improve login error messages (yes, capitalization counts)

2. Make a "needing ANY Nepali work" page to direct translators to.

3. Put userpics in user list

4. JSify recording directions

5. Make lesson creation and "Add to your lesson" only show up for teachers

6. Delint, retest everything, check whether fns all have correct loginrequired/transaction


BACKEND

1. interleave mp3s when teacher creates mp3 (can we just have a download lesson option? - it would be significantly easier. What would this mean? Having them all as a playlist of separate mp3s? I think that's fine.)

2. Ajaxify sentences.html (a bit complicated I think, should avoid reloading audio -- I think only need to Ajaxify add translation and del everything.)
