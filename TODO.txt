INTERFACE

1. fix basic functionality
   - differentiate profiles
   - fix profile not loading if there's no image (<img src="{{ user.profile.image.url }}" />)

2. Make record page less ugly and have it give context as to what you should do
   - For english recording:
       Give English sentence and specify that you are recording in english
   - For nepali recording
       Give English sentence, all nepali translations and specify that recording in nepali
   - For all
       Give generic message about allowing microphone and troubleshooting and such

3. Style the class "errorlist" so it looks less bad (there's a nice one in sentence we could use)
   - when you do {{errors}} it has class errorlist, maybe just make it red or something

4. make index (and "Everest" in nav) redirect to the user type's main page

5. Change the page header css to fix awkwardness (a little bit better)

BACKEND

1. interleave mp3s when teacher creates mp3 (can we just have a download lesson option? - it would be significantly easier. What would this mean? Having them all as a playlist of separate mp3s? I think that's fine.)

2. Ajaxify sentences.html (a bit complicated I think, should avoid reloading audio -- I think only need to Ajaxify add translation and del everything.)

3. Email verification, and email password reset (I started working on this, haven't done much yet though)
   - Templated html/text emails
   - Tokens and such (can mostly copy from my hw7)
   - Need to think about how password reset is done
      I was thinking you click a link, it sends an email, you click a link in the email, and then
      it sends you a temporary password. If you send more than one reset request, only the latest one is
      valid (what do you think? -- sounds good)
