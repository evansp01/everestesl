INTERFACE

2. Make record page less ugly and have it give context as to what you should do
   - For english recording:
       Give English sentence and specify that you are recording in english
   - For nepali recording
       Give English sentence, all nepali translations and specify that recording in nepali
   - For all
       Give generic message about allowing microphone and troubleshooting and such

3. Style the class "errorlist" so it looks less bad (there's a nice one in sentence we could use)
   - when you do {{errors}} it has class errorlist, maybe just make it red or something

4. make index (and "Everest" in nav) redirect to the user type's main page

5. Change the page header css to fix awkwardness (a little bit better)

6. Make emails less bad

BACKEND

1. interleave mp3s when teacher creates mp3 (can we just have a download lesson option? - it would be significantly easier. What would this mean? Having them all as a playlist of separate mp3s? I think that's fine.)

2. Ajaxify sentences.html (a bit complicated I think, should avoid reloading audio -- I think only need to Ajaxify add translation and del everything.)

EXTRA

display related sentences during sentence creation (TFIDF) (did a little?)
